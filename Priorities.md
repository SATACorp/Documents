# Priorties
### 1. Usability	
#### We want the end product to be usable and as seamless as possible, which is the result of successful development.
### 2. Correctness	
#### We want our app to work the way we design it to, which is important to solving our problem.
### 3. Learnability
#### We want the users to be able to grasp the purpose of our app very quickly, as we are designing the app around how our potential users already use technology. 
### 4. Reusability
#### It is a goal for us to see how our app's use can be brought to another level or implemented in a different way.
###  5. User efficiency
#### Users need to be able to use the app naturally and quickly without much of a learning curve
### 6. Usefulness	
#### We want the idea and purpose of the app to be useful in providing people with news.
### 7. Performance
#### Our app will be loading mostly external data, so we want this to happen smoothly enough to keep the user experience enjoyable.
### 8. Consistency
#### We are using Instagram's API as a base for this app, so we want users to be familiar with many actions and information presented in the app.
### 9. Robustness	
#### We don't want the app to be easily breakable, as it may reflect poorly onto other design qualities.
### 10. Privacy
#### We are utilizing Instagram's API, so it is important that user's information is secure.
### 11. Reliability	
#### The app's behavior shouldn't necesarilly change, but we are open to having it evolve if we take this idea further after this class
### 12. Verifiability	
#### Our end goal of making youth more informed about news is difficult to gauge directly, yet it is still important.
### 13. Accessibility
#### Acessiblity is certainly important to us, but we may not have to time or resources to implement anything advanced that will make our app exceedingly useful by disabled individuals.
### 14. Portability	
#### This is important, but we don't think it will take much time to succeed in, as we are simply going to make a web app to make sure it is accessible.
### 15. Security
#### Our app will not be used at a scale significant enough to warrant security issues, also the API we use will provide a base level of security.
### 16. Interoperability	
#### We don't envision a significant amount of cross-system behavior, so it is difficult to prioritize it over many other things.
### 17. Maintainability
#### We don't envision this product being maintained past this class, so we simply want to get it to work. This doesn't mean we will ignore good code structure.
