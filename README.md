Mission Statement: Seamlessly implementing diverse news sources into social media to solve media illiteracy


Problem Statement: Instagram is currently one of the world's most popular social media platforms. Social Media like Instagram has arrested the attention of growing children, so much so that teens in today's world don't "have the time" to stay up to date on current events or pressing news matters. This causes a lack of general knowledge in these teens, that manifests itself very deeply into them that by the time they are adults, they don't know the future of their society and how they can positively benefit it. There are many solutions to condense news and reduce time spent to learn about latest news, but there are no solutions that target the audience of these teenagers who have no propensity to check news sources.
