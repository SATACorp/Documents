Mission Statement: Seamlessly implementing diverse news sources into social media to solve media illiteracy


Problem Statement: Instagram is currently one of the world's most popular social media platforms. Social Media like Instagram has arrested the attention of growing children, so much so that teens in today's world don't "have the time" to stay up to date on current events or pressing news matters. By slowly integrating relevant news sources in an instagram user's feed, we can inform these teenagers about local news and attempt to mitigate media/news illiteracy
