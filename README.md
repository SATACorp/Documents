Mission Statement: Seamlessly implementing diverse news sources into social media to solve media illiteracy


Problem Statement: Instagram is currently one of the world's most popular social media platforms. Social Media like Instagram has arrested the attention of growing children, so much so that teens in today's world don't "have the time" to stay up to date on current events or pressing news matters. This causes a lack of general knowledge in these teens, that manifests itself very deeply into them that by the time they are adults, they don't know the future of their society and how they can positively benefit it. This lack of general knowledge impacts these teens when the turn into adults because they can't make informed decisions in matters like voting, or potentially making dangerous decisions that harms our country. One great example of this affecting our society is when in 2015, PPP(public policy polling) released a poll that wanted to get the public opinion on several topics one of them including bombing Agrabah (the fictional city from Aladdin), and 30% of Republican respondents said that they were in favor of it. Uninformed decisions like these can lead to harmful consequences like uneducated voting. Aside from this, a general lack of knowledge about current events and world news also can lead to ignorance and intolerance that can have lasting negative social ramifications. There are many solutions to condense news and reduce time spent to learn about latest news, but there are no solutions that target the audience of these teenagers who have no propensity to check news sources. 

Instagram is currently one of the world's most popular social media platforms. Social Media like Instagram has arrested the attention of growing children, so much so that teens in today's world don't "have the time" to stay up to date on current events or pressing news matters. Despite the prevalence of cell phones and access to the Internet in the modern era, teenagers nowadays generally don't have the propensity for - or an interest in - keeping up with news sources and getting informed on current events. A general lack of knowledge about these important topics can slowly create an uninformed population. Ultimately, this population has to make decisions about the future of their society; poor choices can create cascading effects that can seriously impact future generations down the line. It's important to bring news and current events to prospective voters today, but in such a way that it becomes an everyday part of life rather than an intensive chore that's forced upon them. In doing so, teenagers can have the information they need to become productive members of society and set the standard for future generations to follow.
