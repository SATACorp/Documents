Mission Statement: Seamlessly implementing diverse news sources in social media to solve media illiteracy


Problem Statement: Instagram is currently one of the world's most popular social media platforms. Currently one of the platform's main sources of revenue are the advertisments they run as part of the "stories" feature. Since the "stories" feature on Instagram is "click-through" and can easily be tapped and skipped over, the revenue that they can be picking up from story ads could be so much higher if the content was less avoidable, or placed in a more strategic place.
