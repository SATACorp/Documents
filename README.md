Mission Statement: Seamlessly implementing diverse news sources into social media to solve media illiteracy


Problem Statement: Instagram is currently one of the world's most popular social media platforms. Social Media like Instagram has arrested the attention of growing children, so much so that teens in today's world don't "have the time" to stay up to date on current events or pressing news matters. This causes a lack of general knowledge in these teens, that manifests itself very deeply into them that by the time they are adults, they don't know the future of their society and how they can positively benefit it. This lack of general knowledge impacts these teens when the turn into adults because they can't make informed decisions in matters like voting, or potentially making dangerous decisions that harms our country. One great example of this affecting our society is when in 2015, PPP(public policy polling) released a poll that wanted to get the public opinion on several topics one of them including bombing Agrabah (the fictional city from Aladdin), and 30% of Republican respondents said that they were in favor of it. Uninformed decisions like these can lead to harmful consequences like uneducated voting. There are many solutions to condense news and reduce time spent to learn about latest news, but there are no solutions that target the audience of these teenagers who have no propensity to check news sources.
